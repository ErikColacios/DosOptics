# Dos Ã’ptics web page

I made this website with love for my trusted optical store. 
The main objective was to represent the diferent services and product areas that they sell in the store and then show it's physical location, so the viewer can get a solid representation of the philosophy of the company and how to get there.

This is a static webpage. That means the whole content is placed locally and does not run in the server, and also has no database because it has not been necessary so far.
